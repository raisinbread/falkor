Introduction
============

Warm regards, seeker, and welcome to the first step along a journey of
Faith and excellence. A city-state of warriors, scholars, poets, and
preachers, Targossas represents the pinnacle of zeal for Creation and
its prosperity. Under the watchful gaze of the Bloodsworn Divine, we
look to the Light and walk in Righteousness to see Good's aims achieved,
that the work began by Ayar-now-Sarapis continues as intended.

This tome comprises a basic introduction to our Faith and culture, and
gives guidance on obtaining citizenship for those outside our walls.
Read on with the understanding that the information herein is
deliberately sparse, and that you are ultimately responsible for your
own education. Targossas is not for those who lack initiative.

Should you find yourself possessed of the courage and humility to serve
a greater cause, you are encouraged to speak with a citizen, or directly
contact the Ambassador or Prophet of Enlightenment. The Dawnspear awaits
you.

In service and Faith,

Seelie Otanthalian, Ambassador
Talamond Averial, Prophet of Enlightenment

========================================
The Creation of Targossas, the Dawnspear
========================================

What follows is the account of the Dawnspear's creation, as scribed by
Father Bahtell on the 15th day of Ero, 618 years after the fall of the
Seleucarian Empire.

                                 - - -

This month, the Refugees of Shallam were summoned by Lord Deucalion and
Lady Aurora to view our new home of Targossas, the Dawnspear:

Aurora, the Lightbringer says, "When Bal'met threatened Creation, We
called you to Our banner to fight. You answered Our call, and We were
victorious."

Aurora, the Lightbringer says, "The fight did not end with Bal'met's
fall at Nishnatoba. The forces of Chaos, Darkness, and Evil remain a
threat."

Aurora, the Lightbringer says, "The Jewel once shone in the East. She
fell, but her people remain undiminished. You have rallied in the face
of your loss, and you are stronger for it. You make Us proud."

Deucalion, the Righteous Fire says, "It has been a hard path. You have
been refugees, wanderers without a home."

Aurora, the Lightbringer says, "Abbess, your kindness and hospitality to
these wanderers is a testament to the goodness of your people."

A youthful blush creeps across the wrinkled face of the Abbess, who
gives a reverent bow.

Aurora, the Lightbringer says, "Your peaceful ways shall resume once
more, with the blessings of the Light upon you for all eternity."

Deucalion, the Righteous Fire says, "Refugees, your wandering is at an
end. Please follow Aurora or Myself."

Fire and fury attend Deucalion, His form burning swiftly into little
more than ash and smoke.

A searing flame of purest ivory erupts beneath Aurora, enveloping Her in
blinding illumination. When it dissipates, the Lightbringer is gone.

The golden splendour of Aurora's form descends to illuminate the
southern Zaphar River, followed only a second later by the white-hot
fire of Deucalion's passage.

Rich motes of lucent clarity suffuse the skies as the Lightbringer
evokes, "Refugees. Wanderers. Devout servants of Good, of Light, of
Righteousness. We promised you a home."

The firmament burns with white-hot fire as the pure, baritone voice of
Deucalion calls out, "It is time We fulfilled that promise."

Standing upon the shore of the Zaphar, Aurora wields the Sword of
Dunamis in both hands, the blade pointing downward.

The Lightbringer gestures to Deucalion. At once, He moves to Her side,
grasping the sword's hilt below where Her hands rest.

Hand-in-hand, the Bloodsworn Gods raise the legendary weapon, where it
gleams with supernatural brilliance within the firmament.

Together, the Gods thrust the blade into the riverbank, and a sharp
crack rings out, rumbling across Sapience with a heaving roar.

As the bedrock stirs, the Zaphar River begins to froth and foment,
rising to its banks with torrid savagery.

The continent shifts suddenly, and a fissure tears asunder the quiet
expanse to the east of the Zaphar. The split widens as it races towards
the sea, stone and silt crumbling inward to form a dry, empty riverbed.

Large chunks of stone shear away from the cliffs along the eastern
coastline, plummeting into the waters of the Eusian Sea as the fissure
reaches Sapience's edge.

Aurora and Deucalion release Their hold upon the Sword of Dunamis, which
remains firmly implanted in the riverbed.

Visible from dozens of miles away, the vibrant colors of the immense
sword fade as it turns to stone, an enduring monument to the permanent
alteration of the landscape.

Eager and strong, a wall of water surges around the sword and along the
channel, thundering towards the coastline.

The newly born river rushes toward the cliffs, splitting itself around
multiple spits of higher ground and forming islands in the midst flowing
water.

The water reaches the cliffs and leaps free, forming a triad of
waterfalls that carry the river downward to reunite with the sea.

The churning river calms and slows as it fills its new banks.

As the moon shines brightly within the heavens, the newborn river begins
to calm and settle along its course, reflecting an argent light within
its banks.

Rich motes of lucent clarity suffuse the skies as the Lightbringer
evokes, "Behold: Targossas, the Dawnspear!"

Rich motes of lucent clarity suffuse the skies as the Lightbringer
evokes, "Let it be a stronghold, guarded by silvered water!"

The firmament burns with white-hot fire as the pure, baritone voice of
Deucalion calls out, "To the devout We entrust Targossas. Upon this
sacred ground the servants of Light and Righteousness find shelter."

Deucalion, the Righteous Fire says, "The Isle of Ram is where you shall
locate your library, within which We hope you will accumulate and
preserve knowledge such that future generations may serve Our cause."

Deucalion, the Righteous Fire says, "The rough intention though is:
River islands are the wealthier/nicer parts of the city. Brighthold and
Ram are enclosed by the Riverwall (or will be) and are oriented towards
government and perhaps commerce."

Deucalion, the Righteous Fire says, "And the ocean islands below are
where the destitute and those lacking sufficient Righteousness shall
dwell."

Deucalion, the Righteous Fire says, "The docks will provide gainful
employment for the otherwise shiftless."

Aurora, the Lightbringer says, "I think the first task will be the
construction of two new roads."

Aurora, the Lightbringer says, "One to go west, following the Silverveil
along its southern bank, to the Raphaelan Highway."

Deucalion, the Righteous Fire says, "And one to go north, to follow the
eastern coast up to the Eastern Road."

Deucalion, the Righteous Fire says, "The city won't be completed
overnight, but We trust that you shall succeed and prosper!"

Aurora, the Lightbringer says, "We will work with you to lay out the
details of the city in the coming months."

Deucalion, the Righteous Fire says, "Now, I must depart. But I wish to
leave you with a single thought."

Deucalion, the Righteous Fire says, "What has begun here today shall
ring throughout the world, and shall echo to the future. Ensure the
music you create is harmonious, righteous, and embodies the light."

====================================
The Foundational Ideals of Targossas
====================================

All citizens of Targossas are sworn to the service of Good.

Good is an absolute and unchanging force spawned by Creation for the
purpose of ensuring the continued prosperity and advancement of
Creation.

Lord Deucalion the Righteous Fire and Lady Aurora the Lightbringer are
the Bloodsworn Divine and the Creators of Targossas, the Dawnspear.

The Bloodsworn Divine speak the Truth of Good and guide Targossas in all
matters. They are the bedrock of Targossas and Their will is our
command.

Light is the guiding force of the servants of Good, illuminating the
path of the devout and infusing them with the drive and motivation
needed to act as conduits of Good.

Righteousness is the course of necessary actions that must be taken for
the advancement of Good's cause.
 
Service in Targossas requires that you defend her whenever she is
attacked, actively contribute to the city's growth, and facilitate the
destruction of the enemies of Good through whatever talents you may
possess. Constantly seek to improve yourself so you may serve better.

Any who seek to hinder the advancement of Creation are the enemies of
Good. These include, most prominently, Evil, Darkness, and Chaos.

(Page 6)

==============
Voices of Good
==============

Coming from all walks of life with diverse mentality and experience, the
Faithful nonetheless serve with unparalleled focus. In unified voice and
action, we strive ever forward, continually demonstrating the power of
our solidarity to further Creation and thwart our enemies.

                                 - - -

"All are born Good. All. Their journey through life may lead them down
the path of iniquity, but My guidance is there to encourage a return to
that place from whence they started out. Some may refuse to accept this,
their lives held forfeit for their refusal. Others may seek Light once
more, a victory for us all."
 - Lady Aurora, the Lightbringer

 "Fire scours away all that is impure. I am that fire. You shall be that
fire. We shall scour away the sickness that poisons the land and see it
made pure again. We shall purge Creation of this filth, root and
branch!"
 - Lord Deucalion, the Righteous Fire

"We who serve Good are not a peaceful people. Given the constant threats
of the modern era, this is not a luxury we can afford. It is not a
matter of bloodlust. It is a matter of ensuring the continued prosperity
of Creation. There are threats to Creation. There are forces that wish
to control it and force it into a mold of Their own imagining. There are
forces that wish to destroy it. There are individuals that have no
particular goal but simply enjoy destroying things for their own
amusement."
 - Aldair d'Vast

"We are all part of something far greater than our individual selves. As
each brick in a structure is individually cut and chiseled by a
stonemason's hand, so too are those who serve Them - woven from the

threads of fate and cut from different cloth, as it were. Individual
people with their own aspirations and dreams, personal desires and so
on."
 - Daeir Wintermourne

"No matter the winds that whip, the rivers of blood that flow, the fog
that threatens to choke the flame, a servant of Good must boldly push
forth. A Righteous flame must burn within our souls, pushing us to carry
out what must be done. It will not be easy. There will be danger, there
will be hardship, there will be pain. But that is the nature of Heroism
- the willingness to act in service to Good, even when our basic
instincts would have us seek shelter."
 - Jayden al-Mu'allima

"Growth can manifest in several different ways. Physical, mental,
spiritual. The presence is obvious. A young one's eyes burning with
devotion as they learn of what the Bloodsworn have done for us. A young
Dawnblade standing taller, having grown just enough to stand alongside
the Judicator in the field of battle for Creation. The curious smile of
a Harbinger, having recently learned new ways to preach. Growth is

everywhere, if you look."
 - Tesha al Ashtad

"On the subject of free will, Targossas, know that you are free to have
thoughts of your own. It is your right; it was our blessed Creator
Himself who bequeathed it to you. The Bloodsworn, in Their majesty,
support this freedom for--like inventive Lord Phaestus pioneering the
spark of life at the dawn of Creation--They recognize the futility and
absolute joylessness of having clockwork automons in service to Them.
Indeed, the independent will is what makes the unyielding faith and
selfless sacrifice so meaningful."
 - Halos Vorondil

"Our ultimate goal, as is the goal of Good, is Growth - the Growth of
all Creation, the maximization of Creation's potential, as opposed to
the strengthening of a small part at the expense of others. We seek
Purity so that the realm and ourselves are unhindered in our Growth. We
Sacrifice in order to obtain this Purity. We find and reveal Truth to
identify impurities to be cleansed and the best means of obtaining
Growth."
 - Farrah Roualt
