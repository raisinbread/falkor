Nestled within the familiar embrace of the Pash Valley, Targossas, the Guardians' Hearth, is a
refuge for the defenders of Creation. Shaped from Memory by the will of Lady Aurora and Lord 
Deucalion, the Bloodsworn Divine, the city's golden domes and stone-clad bulwarks radiate exalted 
effulgence, offering sanctuary to the acolytes of Good.

Creation's keepers convene at the Hearth's Righteous Fire, bathed in the steadfast radiance of the
Light. This shared commitment is a tribute to their enduring resilience and unwavering vigilance, 
for it is here the chalice of renewal nourishes and strengthens the devoted servants of the 
Bloodsworn in their perpetual watch.

In this union of divine and mortal resolve, Targossas stands firm, a beacon amidst the boundless
tapestry of Good. Blade and bond alike are forged within Targossian flames, for there is place 
aplenty at the Bloodsworn's Hearth: a welcome respite for the loyal and a burning brand for the 
heretic.
