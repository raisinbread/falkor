 Introduction

In the holy city of the Bloodsworn, prayer plays an essential role in
maintaining the fervour and clarity of we who make our home in Their
hallowed streets. We pray for guidance. We pray for succour. We pray for
understanding. We pray to give thanks and praise.

We pray as one and we pray as individuals. We pray often. The pages of
this Breviary contain the holy prayers that we offer up each month. Each
month of the year is associated with one of the primary ideals of
Targossas and the prayer for that month corresponds with that theme. In
addition, many citizens find the use of prayer beads helps to focus
their minds during prayer.

Which theme goes with which month, along with the corresponding prayer
bead, can be found in the Prayer Calendar located on page four.

Raise your voices up, blessed citizens of the Dawnspear. Let Them hear
your fervor that They may never find need to turn Their gaze from us.
Strengthen your spirits and hearts so where They lead, you always
follow.

Acknowledgements:

The city of Targossas would like to acknowledge the work of Aldair
d'Vast and Aodfionn Wintermourne for the crafting and refining of the
prayers within the first edition. Thanks go to Laniara Vorondil for
labouring through a massive rewrite for the second edition, and to the
Faithful of Targossas who offered input and helped by their willingness
to be an active part of the city. In addition, the design work of Evony
Alexandrian Lensara in the creation of this Breviary has enhanced the
beauty of the project as a whole.

Prayer Calendar
