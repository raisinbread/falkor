Karma is a force of fate which occultists use to twist reality around
them. It is sometimes imbued within objects which have unique focal
points in history. By studying these items, occultists gain karma to
fuel their chaotic powers.

The following is a list of karmic items, the denizens that hold them,
and where they are found. As servants of Good, it is our duty to ensure
that these items are not allowed to fall into the hands of our enemies.

** Karmic items should be destroyed into the Chalice of Purity **

The Chalice of Purity is in the Alcove of Purity inside the Temple of
Righteous Fire. WALK TO DEUCALIONTEMPLE, and once you arrive, head east.

This will ensure that the item is properly taken out of circulation for
that cycle, thereby slowing the accumulation of karmic power by
occultists.

To see the total amount of karma that has been purged simply:
TOUCH CHALICE

To see a breakdown of all individuals and the amount of karma they have
removed from Creation:
TOUCH CHALICE ALL

Denizens are listed below in alphabetical order.
